# Unstructured API MCP Server

An MCP server implementation for interacting with the Unstructured API. This server provides tools to list sources and workflows.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
- `uv add "mcp[cli]"`
- `uv pip install --upgrade unstructured-client python-dotenv`

or use `uv sync`.

2. Set your Unstructured API key as an environment variable.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory, and add a line with your key: `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"`

To test in local, any working key that pointing to prod env would work. However, to be able to return valid results from client's side (e.g, Claude for Desktop), your personal key that is fetched from `https://platform.unstructured.io/app/account/api-keys` is needed.

## Running the Server
Using the MCP CLI:
```bash
mcp run server.py
```

or:
```bash
uv run server.py
```

#### run_workflow
Run a specific workflow.

Parameters:
- `workflow_id`: ID of the workflow to run

#### update_workflow
Update an existing workflow.

Parameters:
- `workflow_id`: ID of the workflow to update
- `workflow_config`:
    A dictionary containing the updated workflow configuration (must include required fields as per UpdateWorkflow model).
    More specifically, it's a `CreateWorkflowTypedDict` that one can refer its params [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client/blob/main/src/unstructured_client/models/shared/createworkflow.py#L33).


#### delete_workflow
Delete a specific workflow.

Parameters:
- `workflow_id`: ID of the workflow to delete

## Claude Desktop Integration

To install in Claude Desktop:

1. Go to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` and create a `claude_desktop_config.json`.
2. In that file add:
```bash
{
    "mcpServers":
    {
        "UNS_MCP":
        {
            "command": "ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/.local/bin/uv",
            "args":
            [
                "--directory",
                "ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/UNS-MCP",
                "run",
                "server.py"
            ],
            "env":
            [
            "UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY":"<your key>"
            ],
            "disabled": false
        }
    }
}
```
3. Restart Claude Desktop.

4. Example Issues seen from Claude Desktop.
    - You will see `No destinations found` when you query for a list of destionation connectors. Check your API key in `.env` or in your config json, it needs to be your personal key in `https://platform.unstructured.io/app/account/api-keys`.

## Debugging tools

Anthropic provides `MCP Inspector` tool to debug/test your MCP server. Run the following command to spin up a debugging UI. From there, you will be able to add environment variables (pointing to your local env) on the left pane. Include your personal API key there as env var. Go to `tools`, you can test out the capabilities you add to the MCP server.
```
mcp dev server.py
```

## Running locally minimal client
```
uv run python minimal_client/run.py server.py
```

## CHANGELOG.md

Any new developed features/fixes/enhancements will be added to CHANGELOG.md. 0.x.x-dev pre-release format is preferred before we bump to a stable version.
